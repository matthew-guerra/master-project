# Navigating Ancestry and Racial Classification Amongst Multiracial Indigenous Americans

## Abstract: 
How does proximity to a Homeland shape the racial decision-making process for individuals with mixed Indigenous ancestry? Can rural residency account for the influence of the Homeland variable? Using data from the American Community Survey (ACS) from 2010 to 2020, this study examines the relationship between geographic location and Indigenous self-identification by estimating multinomial logistic regression models. Findings reveal that living in a Homeland or being of Hispanic Origin were the strongest predictors of  Indigenous alone identification. These results reinforce previous research on the Homeland variable as a key predictor of Indigenous racial identification while expanding on its application to an adult multiracial population. By examining how structural and spatial factors shape racial decision-making, this study contributes to a broader discussion on Indigenous identity formation, multiraciality, and the role of place in racial decision-making.
