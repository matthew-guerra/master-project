title: "The Nexus Between Ancestry and Racial Classification Amongst Indigenous Americans"
shorttitle: "Paper"
abstract: This paper leverages census data to investigate the intricate relationship between individuals reported ancestry and their self-identified racial classification on the United States Census. Analyzing a dataset drawn from U.S. census records spanning 2010-2020, this research employs statistical techniques to discern patterns, trends, and discrepancies in how individuals perceive their ancestral heritage and racial identity.
