	abstract = {Social scientists have become increasingly interested in the racial identification choices of 
multiracial individuals, partly as a result of the federal government’s new ‘‘check all that 
apply’’ method of racial identification. However, the majority of work to date has narrowly 
defined the population of multiracial individuals as the ‘‘biracial’’ children of single-race 
parents. In this article, we use the open-ended ancestry questions on the 1990 and 2000 
5\% samples of the US Census to identify a multiracial population that is potentially broader 
in its understanding of multiraciality. Relative to other studies, we find stronger historical 
continuity in the patterns of hypodescent and hyperdescent for part-black and part- 
American Indian ancestry individuals respectively, while we find that multiple-race 
identification is the modal category for those of part-Asian ancestry. We interpret this as 
evidence of a new, more flexible classification regime for groups rooted in more recent 
immigration. Our results suggest that future work on multiracial identification must pay 
closer attention to the varied histories of specific multiracial ancestry groups.},

            Conceptualizing and operationalizing American Indian populations is challenging. Each census for decades has seen the American Indian population increase substantially more than expected, with indirect and qualitative evidence that this is due to changes in individuals’ race responses. We apply uniquely suited (but not nationally representative) linked data from the 2000 and 2010 decennial censuses (N = 3.1 million) and the 2006–2010 American Community Survey (N = 188,131) to address three research questions. First, to what extent do American Indian people have different race responses across data sources? We find considerable race response change, especially among multiple-race and/or Hispanic American Indians. Second, how are people who change responses different from or similar to those who do not? We find three sets of American Indians: those who (1) had the same race and Hispanic responses in 2000 and 2010, (2) moved between single-race and multiple-race American Indian responses, and (3) added or dropped the American Indian response, thus joining or leaving the enumerated American Indian population. People in groups (1) and (2) were relatively likely to report a tribe, live in an American Indian area, report American Indian ancestry, and live in the West. Third, how are people who join a group different from or similar to those who leave it? Multivariate models show general similarity between joiners and leavers in group (1) and in group (2). Population turnover is hidden in cross-sectional comparisons; people joining each subpopulation of American Indians are similar in number and characteristics to those who leave it.},

One century after Indian Removal of the antebellum era, Native peoples in the American Southeast provide an important but often overlooked example of how racial policies, this time rooted in eugenics, effected a documentary erasure of Native peoples and communities.},
